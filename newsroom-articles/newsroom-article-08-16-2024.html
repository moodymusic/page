            <p>Le John is swiftly becoming one of the defining voices of his generation, a 21-year-old singer-songwriter and record producer hailing from Tacloban City. His latest single, "Akala Ko," has just crossed the 100,000 stream mark on Spotify, solidifying his status as a rising star in the OPM (Original Pilipino Music) scene.</p>
            <p>Released on April 5, 2024, "Akala Ko" immediately resonated with listeners, earning a spot on Spotify’s New Music Friday Philippines upon its debut. The track is a poignant sequel to his earlier hit, "Ikaw Na Ba," which not only dominated local city charts across the Philippines but was also featured on prestigious playlists like Tatak Pinoy and OPM Rising.</p>
            <p>Le John’s ability to craft emotive, relatable songs while handling every aspect of production himself—writing, composing, producing—sets him apart in an industry brimming with talent. With "Akala Ko" continuing to chart and gain momentum, Le John is proving that his music is here to stay, and fans are eagerly anticipating what he will create next.</p>
